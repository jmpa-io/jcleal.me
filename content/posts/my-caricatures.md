### Hi 👋🏼

I wanted to share a collection of caricatures I've had made (or had made for me) over the years - I had picked up a few before, but I really started collecting them properly after I travelled to **South Korea** in **2023**.

I love seeing how different artists interpret how I look — it’s weird and funny and kind of fascinating.

Check them out! (they are broken down by the year they were made) 👇🏼

[2025](#2025) | [2024](#2024) | [2023](#2023) | [2022](#2022) | [2019](#2019) | [2012](#2012) | [2011](#2011)

## 2025.

<img src="/img/caricatures/2025, Edinburgh, Scotland, 2 1.jpg" alt="2025 | Edinburgh, Scotland | 2 1" class="centered-img" />

> This caricature was made with my Mum and I as the subject - my parents came over from Australia to visit my partner & I in **Edinburgh, Scotland** (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿). We got this to commemorate the occasion near **Edinburgh Castle** (for a third time)! 👨‍👩‍👦

> This was a last minute caricature made by a lovely artist in **Edinburgh, Scotland** (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿) near **Edinburgh Castle** (again). I wanted to grab one on my last day in my `20`s! 🥳 🎈 🎉

## 2024.

<img src="/img/caricatures/2024, Fiverr, 1 3.png" alt="2024 | Fiverr | 1 1" class="centered-img" />

> This one was made by **[@sindorochaidar](https://www.fiverr.com/sindorochaidar)** on **Fiverr** - I largely wanted a laugh (and he delivered)! 😀

> This was the first official caricature I had made in **Edinburgh, Scotland** (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿) near **Edinburgh Castle**. The man who painted this, using watercolor, looked & dressed like Jack Sparrow which was very interesting! He has a unique style and was very popular! 🏴‍☠️🛳️

> This one is a bit of a joke - I made one myself! At the time, I was carrying a fair few caricatures around while attending the the **Fringe Festival** in **Edinburgh, Scotland** (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿) - I wanted to see if I could make one! (it's MUCH harder than it looks) 😂

<img src="/img/caricatures/2024, Brighton, United Kingdom, 1 1.jpg" alt="2024 | Brighton, United Kingdom | 1 1" class="centered-img" />

> One of my favourite caricatures - I got this commissioned by **[Robert Farrow](https://robertfarrowartist.com/)**, an incredible artist I met in **Brighton, United Kingdom** (🇬🇧). In person, this has such vivid color! I'll be asking for another one from him in the future 👏🏼.

<img src="/img/caricatures/2024, London, United Kingdom, 1 1.jpg" alt="2024 | London, United Kingdom | 1 1" class="centered-img" />

> Not the biggest fan of this one, mainly because of the artist. I think it is a nice drawing, but yeah, not the best time while it was being made in **London, United Kingdom** (🇬🇧). I do like comparing it to the one from **Brussels, Belgium** though! 😂

> This flattering one was drawn by a kind man in **Brussels, Belgium** (🇧🇪). Halfway through, it suddenly poured — but thankfully, he had an umbrella! ☂️

> A quality drawing from a lovely man in **Prague, Czechia** on **Charles Bridge** (🇨🇿) - I feel he managed to get my style perfectly - a quality drawing! There were a fair few people passing me and giving a classic thumbs up 👍🏼.

> A beautiful caricature from **[@shinji](https://www.instagram.com/shinji_arts)** who drew himself in the background! We had a great chat together in **Kyoto, Japan** (🇯🇵). I love his style, it reminds me of Stardew Valley! 🐄🌾🚜

## 2023.

<img src="/img/caricatures/2023, Jeoungju, South Korea, 1 1.png" alt="2023 | Jeoungju, South Korea | 1 1" class="centered-img" />

> This is a caricature I got made in **Jeoungju, South Korea** (🇰🇷). It's my favourite one! The artist made this within 5 or so minutes, which was insane to me. The artist didn't speak english either, so it was a very nice experience when he did the reveal. One day I'll go back and get a new one made 👏🏼.

<img src="/img/caricatures/2022, Melbourne, Australia, 1 1.jpg" alt="2022 | Melbourne, Australia | 1 1" class="centered-img" />

> While not a new drawing per say, to signify the end of my relationship with my ex, I modified and changed this caricature to fit my life going forward in **Melbourne, Australia** (🇦🇺). I use this image for my profile pictures online A LOT!

> This is the first caricature I ever got made, with my ex, at the **Fugi-Q Highland** theme park near **Mt Fui, Japan** (🇯🇵). The artist captured us well, minus our really large teeth! 😁

<img src="/img/caricatures/2012, Geelong, Australia, 1 1.jpg" alt="2012 | Geelong, Australia | 1 1" class="centered-img" />

> One of my first caricatures! It was made by friend, **Jess**, while we were in **Year 12** in **Geelong, Australia** (🇦🇺). I had blonde hair like a porcupine at this time, no joke. 🦔 😂

## 2011.

<img src="/img/caricatures/2011, Geelong, Australia, 1 1.jpg" alt="2011 | Geelong, Australia | 1 1" class="centered-img" />

> Funnily enough, this was the first caricature I had made of me - it was by a teacher, **Mr Nutt**, while I was taking a serious test in **Geelong, Australia** (🇦🇺). I didn't appreciate it at the time, for some reason, but looking back this one is one of my favourites. He really captured me, my mood, and my hair at the time. Thank you, **Mr Nutt**! 🙏
