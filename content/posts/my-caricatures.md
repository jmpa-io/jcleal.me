Hi! 👋🏼

I wanted to share a collection of my caricatures I've had made (or made for me) over the years:

- [2025](#2025).
- [2024](#2024).
- [2023](#2023).
- [2012](#2012).

## 2024

> This one was made by [@sindorochaidar](https://www.fiverr.com/sindorochaidar) on **Fiverr** - I largely wanted a laugh (and he delivered)! 😀

## 2023

<img src="/img/caricatures/2023 - Jeoungju, South Korea 1 1.png" alt="Jeoungju, South Korea 1" class="centered-img" />

> This is a caricature I got made in **Jeoungju, South Korea** (🇰🇷). It's my favourite one! The artist made this within 5 or so minutes, which was insane to me. One day I'll go back and get a new one made 👏🏼.
